The Smart  City Vision   \nThe District of Columbia (the District)  is working  \nhard  to better  connect  its communities,  build  \neconomic  strength,  protect  the natural  \nenvironment,  and maintain  the safety  and security  \nof its infra structure.  But more progress is \nachievable , and a smarter,  connected  urban  system  \nshow s the way forward  for all of the District’s  \nresidents  and visitors.  A new  “Smart  DC” is needed  \nto address  a multitude  of challenges,  including  \nrecent  and future  growth  pressures,  income  \ndisparities,  and persistent  congestion  across  modes  \nof transportation . \nThe District  has made  substantial  investments  to lay \nthe groundwork  for transforming  into a “smart  \ncity.”1 Smart  DC focuses  on collaboration  across  \nagencies  and sectors  in a strategic  and inclusive  way \nto address  challenges  and capitalize  on the \nopportunities  presented  by 21st-century  technology  \nand best  practices  for city governance  and \nmanagement.   \n1.1. Challenges  \nThe District  has grown  over  17%  in the past  15 years  to an estimated  672,228  residents in \n2015 .2 The Texas  Transportation  Institute’s  annual  Urban  Mobility  Scorecard  places  the \nWashington  region  as one of the most  congested  regions  in the nation , with  45 percent  of \npeak  vehicle  miles travel ed occurring  in congested  conditions.3 Congestion  affects  and transit  \npassengers  in addition  to drivers,  with  Metrobus speeds  averaging  less than  11 miles per hour \nsystem -wide .4 Some  bus corridors  carry  more  than  20,000  riders  daily,  and these  routes  often  \nexperience  crowding  throughout  the day,  especially  at peak  periods.  \nRecent  growth  has brought  prosperity,  but it has also brought  the District  has som e of the \ngreatest  income  disparity  of any city in the country.  The top 5 percent  of District  households  \nearn  54 times  as much  as the bottom  20 percent.5 While t he District  has high  smartphone  \npenetration  rates , with  over  75 percent  market  penetration  for smartphones,  and 46 percent  \n                                                      \n1 A smart city is  “one in which information and communication technology facilitates improved insight into and \ncontrol over the various systems tha t affect the lives of residents.” Cuddy et al “The Smart/Connected City and Its \nImplications for Connected Transportation, ” (USDOT ITS Joint Program Office, 2014)  \n2 U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 Decennial Census; U.S. Census  Bureau,  2015 Population Estimates.  \n3 David Schrank et al,  2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard , (Texas Transportation Institute , 2015 )  \n4 Washington Metropolitan Transportation Authority (WMATA), “Evaluation of Bus Travel Speeds ,” (2010 ). \n5 Wes  Rivers, “High and Wide: Income Inequality Gap in the D istrict One of the Biggest in the U.S.” (DC Fiscal Policy \nInstitute, 2014) . Looking Ahead t o Smart DC  \nIn 2045, the  District ’s population has grown to \nalmost 1 million residents, the largest in its \nhistory, and 63 percent more than 2010. \nDespite this growth, people get around to \njobs, schools, museums, and the center of the \nfederal  government wi th minimal delays and \nwithout the loss of life. Time spent en route is \nproductive for residents, workers, and visitors \nthrough a connected information system. \nVehicles are routed around incidents and \nmajor events automatically, without the \noperator even re alizing. Infrastructure is \nmaintained in top condition because of \nautomated feedback from roads, traffic \nsignals, and transit vehicles, which \nautomatically dispatches work crews and \nupdates performance dashboards to support \nlong -term decision -making.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  2 for tablets  as of 2013,6 smartphones  likely  \nincrease  the “digital  divide ,” with  the \nsmartphon e dependent  more  likely  to reach  \ndata  limits  or have  phone  service  cut off \nbecause  of financial  constraints.  Ten percent  \nof Americans  have  a smartphone  but no other  \nway to access  broadband  internet  services.7 \nHowever, the high  adoption  rate is reflected  \nin the transportation  system,  with  over  half of \nparking  meter  transactions  now  happening  \nwith  the ParkMobile  pay-by-cell system.  \nThe District,  as the seat  of the federal  \ngovernment,  also hosts  many  large scale \nspecial  events . For example, o ver 1.8 million  people attended  President  Obama’s  first \ninauguration  in 2009 , and on a daily  basis,  the District’s  streets  carry  motorcades,  host  rallies  \nand other  political  events,  and welcome  over  100,000  visitors.  \n1.2. Meeting  the Challenges  \nSmart  DC emphasizes  opportunities  to connect  transportation  with  the city’s  other  systems,  \nincluding  communications,  the built  and natural  environments,  and the economy.  The vision  for \nSmart  DC connects  to the goals and objectives defined in section 11  and builds  upon  three  key \nelements  in alignment  with  initiatives  across  District  gover nment:  \n\uf0b7 Smart  infrastructure  \n\uf0b7 Smart  user s \n\uf0b7 Smart agencies  \nFigure  2 | Smart  DC Elements  \n \n                                                      \n6 “Top 10 Local US Markets by Smartphone and Tablet Penetration,” Marketing Charts , 6 February 2014. \nhttp://www.marketingcharts.com/online/top -10-local -us-markets -by-smartphone -and-tablet -penetration -39623/.  \n7 Aaron Smith “U.S. Smartphone Use in 2015 ” (Pew Research Center, 2015 ). \nFigu re 1 | Population Growth in DC  \n \nSource s: US Census, DC Office of Planning  \n0225,000450,000675,000900,000\n2000 2006 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  3  \nSmart  infrastructure : Smart  DC takes  an expansive  view  of the District’s transportation  \ninfrastructure , including  travel  corridors  like roads  or rails;  vehicles  like private  cars,  buses,  and \nbikes;  street  furnishings  like benches,  trash  bins,  and streetlights;  to the underlying  public  \nspace.  Unlike  traditional  infrastructure,  smarter  infrastructure  communicates  its status,  \nmaintenance  needs,  and interaction  with  the environment.  Smart  infrastructure  also enables  \nprivate  users  to use public  infrastructure  as data  portals.  \nLike many  cities,  the District’s  transportation  system s struggle  to keep  pace  with  technological  \nchanges  and the growth  of its population.  In order  to support  one of the most  highly -educated  \npopulations  and workforces  in the country,  the District  must  implement  21st -century  \ntechnological  and infrastructure  solutions  today  to continue  to facilitate  the city’s  progress  and \nprepa re for the future.  Smart  DC will deploy  new  and developing  technologies,  particularly  in \nthe connected  and automated  vehicle  arena,  which  will make  the District  a trailblazer  in \nembracing  and integrating  these  technologies.  \nSmart  DC will take an “asset  lite” approach  to acquiring  real-time  awareness  regarding  the \noperational  status  of the system.  System  users,  such  as pedestrians,  bicyclists,  and vehicles  will \ncommunicate  real-time  information  about  asset  conditions  using  state -of-the-art technologies . \nDistrict  fleet  vehicles  will act as probes  to assess  travel  speeds  and roadway  conditions,  \ncrowdsourcing  applications  will be used  for incident  detection,  and advanced  data  analytics  will \nidentify  available  on-street  parking  spaces.  The asset lite approach  also utilizes  a single  asset  for \nmultiple  functions,  such  as in automated  traffic  enforcement  cameras  for traffic  counts,  parking  \navailability,  and incident  verification.  Information  about  asset  condition  and system  operations  \nwill combi ne from  several  sources  to limit  the need  to deploy  single -purpose  assets  and to \nincrease  system  redundancy.  \nSmart  users : Smart  citizens  are empowered  citizens.  The District  envisions  a city in which  its \nresidents,  businesses,  workers,  and visitors  are engaged  in making  their  city a better  place,  by \nusing  connected  devices  and communication  tools.  Today,  many  District  travelers  already  use \ntechnology -based  solutions  to improve  their  transportation  experience,  with  applications  like \npay-by-cell for city parking,  SeeClickFix  to report  infrastructure  in need  of repair,  and RideDC for \nmultimodal trip planning . Smart DC will link with  the District’s  Connect  DC initiative  aimed  at \nbridging  the digital  divide  to ensure  that residents  and visitors  will not need  a smartphone  to \nparticipate  in the smarter  city, while also  enabl ing smartphone  users  to maximize  data  access  \nthrough  the transportation  system s.  \nCitywide  wireless  internet  service  will facilitate  mobile  device  usage,  but new  smart  \ninfrastructure  will also enable  resident  and visitor  feedback,  trip planning,  and diffusion  of \ninformation.  Connected  private  and transit  vehicles,  bikeshare,  and communication  and \ntransportation  infrastructure  will be available  for all travelers.  Users  will also be involved  in new  \nways  to gain  situational  awareness  and find solutions  to city issues  through  crowdsourcing  and \nother  means.  In Smart  DC, residents  and visitors  will improve  the places  where  they  live, work,  \nand play,  and will not be constrained  by the capabilities  of gove rnment  agencies.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  4 Figure  3 | Smart  DC on the Street  \n \nSmart  agenc ies: Fundamental  to the implementation  of Smart  DC is smart  leadership.  Leading \nthis effort  is the District  Department  of Transportation  (DDOT).  As a smart  agency,  DDO T \nembraces  innovation  culture  to make  better  plans  and better  decisions,  and Smart  DC \ninvestments  will allow  it to nimbly  engage  citizens  and more  quickly  implement  optimal  \ninfrastructure.  The smart,  connected  city will supply  the District  government  with  a regular  flow  \nof rich,  meaningful  data,  allowing  DDOT  and partner  agencies  to analyze  the transportation  \nsystem s, and identify  and proactively  respond  to the needs  of its users.  A smarter  DDOT,  along  \nwith  partner  agencies,  including  the District’s  Office  of the Chief  Technology  Officer  (OCTO)  and \nthe Washington  Metropolitan  Area  Transit  Authority  (WMATA),  will leverage  the assets  of both  \nsmart  infrastructure  and smart  users  to implement  smart  technology.  \nHow  the Elements  Interact  \nThe strength  of Smart  DC lies in the connective  tissue  between  each  component.  Smart  DC \nenvisions  a city that is not only  “smart”  but also “connected”  through  several  components:  \nData : The principal  currency  of Smart  DC is data:  each  element  of the smart  city is both  a \ngenerator  and consumer  of data.  Each  data  system  will be closely  integrated  with  networks  \nthroughout  the city, while  also being  aware  of data  privacy  needs.  The District  is already  \nestablishing  standards  in its draft  Open  Data  Policy,  which  will ensure  both  the transparency  \nand security  of the data  the District  collects  (further  detail  in Sectio n 9). \n \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4 , 2016  5 Feedback  and adaptation : Better  information  will \nlead  to faster  and more  effective  change  by each  \ncomponent  in Smart  DC. Information  from  smart  \ninfrastructure  will feed  back  to transportation  system  \nmanagement  centers.  This will in turn  lead  to \nsmarter  and more  responsive  information  for users  \nof all modes,  with  benefits  like better  transit  \ninformation  at stations  and bus stops.  With  \ncommunication  between  all the region’s  data  \nsystems,  users  and institutions  will be better  \nprepared  for and assisted  during  emergency  events.   \nEquity : Ultimately,  interconnections  among  smart  \nagenc ies, smart  infrastructure,  and smart  users  will \nmaintain  and improve  mobility  throughout  the \nregion,  and provide  added  accessibility.  In Smart  DC, \ntransportation  system  will better  connect  citizens  with  the broader  economy  thanks  to faster , \nmore  reliable  transit  and a safer  transportation  network  overall . The District’s  gove rnment  will \nexpand  its current  robust  outreach  and education  offerings  to help  residents , visitors,  and \nbusinesses  better  understand  how  Smart  DC can benefit  them  and evolve  to meet  their  needs.  \nWith  an existing  established  transportation  demand  management  program,  goDCgo,  the \nDistrict  is well-positioned  to demonstrate  the Smart  DC elements  and how  they  work  together.  \nThe proposed One Call -One Click sys tem will ensure access for  travelers of  all ages and abilities.  \nAccess  to Opportunity : The Smart  DC vision  transcends  transportation.  With  smarter  ways  to \nget around,  the District  will make  progress  in many  of the economic  goals  identified  in the US \nDepartment of Transportation’s (USDOT)  Ladders  of Opportunity  initiative.  This will lead  to \nmore  sustainable  land  use choices,  an engaged  and productive  workforce,  and revitalized  \ncommunities.   \n1.3. Smart  DC Investments  \nSmart  DC is a comprehensive  approach  to smart  city deployment  that leverages  assets  and data  \nto improve  agency  operations  and the quality  of service  delivered  to residents,  workers,  \nbusinesses,  and visitors.  Smart  DC is rooted  in four  basic  categories  of implem entation:  \n\uf0b7 Roadside  and roadway  infrastructure  that communicates  with  individual  vehicles  and \ntransportation  systems,  as well as providing  users  with  communications  access.  \n\uf0b7 Vehicle -based  infrastructure  on both  public  and private  fleets  that communicates  with \nroadside  systems  and transportation  management  centers.  \n\uf0b7 Transportation  management  centers  and organizational  investment  that take  in data  \nand prioritize  agency  and asset  management  while  communicating  real-time  \ninformation  to end users.  \n\uf0b7 Data  and User -based infrastructure  that provides  access  portals  and real time  \ninformation  to individuals  and businesses.  \n Looking Ahead to Smart DC  \nThe region is 12 hours into  a 28 -inch \nsnowstorm. The blizzard snarls traffic on \nmain routes, and many roads are \ntreacherous. A 911 call comes in —there’s a \nfour-car crash with severe injuries. The \nsmart dispatch system fuses data on existing \ncongestion and roadway conditions from \nsnow plow s, and dynamically routes first \nresponders through the best available \nroutes. Police and Emergency Medical \nServices get signal priority en route to the \nincident site and the hospital. Response time \nis cut in half. Two lives are saved.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  6 Figure  4 | Pilot  Infrastructure  Diagram  \n \n \nAs a first step  toward  achieving  the Smart  DC vision,  this proposal  outlines  pilot  projects  to \ndemonstrate  the benefits  that a better -connected  city can bring.  This vision  will be realized  \nthrough  investments  that serve  as building  blocks  for citywide  expansion  through  three  \niterative  cycles:  deployment,  integration,  and evaluation.  \nDepl oyment : Smart  DC will deploy  new  technologies  through  roadside  equipment  (RSE)  in the \ndowntown  area and along  selected  major  corridors  (identifi ed in Section  4) and through  on-\nboard  units  (OBU).  The RSE, such as dedicated short range communication  (DSRC) units , will be \ninstalled  and integrated  per USDOT  Intelligent Transportation System s (ITS) architecture  and \nusing  the latest  standards.  Transit  signal  priority  (TSP)  is already  in place  on nearly  100 signals  \nand will expand  to 195 signals  by summer  2016,  accounting  for approximately  12 percent  of all \ntraffic  signals  in the District.  \nThe infrastructure  will be available  for the public,  vendors,  and auto  manufacturers  to evaluate  \ntheir  equipment  during  the Smart  DC pilot.  RSE will broadcast alerts  so that early  adopters  have  \na safety  and travel  incentive  to adopt  the technology.  Features  available  to early  adopters  will \ninclude  traffic  signal  warnings,  curve  speed  warnings,  pedestrian  crossing  warnings,  and red \n \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  7 light  violations.  The District recently  piloted  a project  during  the 2016  Washington  Auto  Show \nto provide  Signal  Phase  and Timing  (SPaT)  through  a central  server  to auto  manufacturers  to \nimprove  safety  at signals  and improve  emissions  by turning  off engines.  \nLeveraging  the current  Federal Highway A dministration ( FHWA )-funded  parkDC  “smart  parking”  \npilot,  additional  RSE will be installed  to monitor  parking  space  occupancy,  allowing  travelers  or \nvehicles  to identify  blocks  with  available  spaces  and DDOT  to adjust  parking  prices  so demand is \nbetter ref lected . Expanded  RSE for loading  zones  will enable  enforcement  and monitoring  of \nfreight  parking  to reduce  double  parking  and communicate  to users.  This will enhance  the \nparking  experience  in the central  business  district  and provide  seamless  integr ation  with the \nrest of the RSE.  \nSmart  kiosks  will be installed  at existing  bus shelters,  Capital  Bikeshare  stations,  and Metrorail  \nentrances  along  the most  important  corridors  for real-time  travel  information,  emergency  \nalerts,  ticket  vending  for off-board  fare collection , and access to city services . To ensure  equity  \nof service,  the kiosks  will be available  to residents  and visitors  alike,  and will provide free public \nwifi. Smart  kiosks  will also act as feedback  centers  for pedestrians , allowing DDOT  to \nunderstan d pedestrian  patterns  at important  locations  and better  plan  for services  during  peak  \nhours  and special  events.  \nDDOT is partnering with several DC agencies on a pilot project which will include the installation \nof small cell antennas in places that enhance  the in -building -wireless service levels  for use in \nand around the building. The proposed pilot would begin with certain District government \nbuildings in the near future. Broader deployment will follow, if successful, and further expand \nthe reach of  free public wifi.   \nAn autonomous  vehicle  testbed  with  enhanced  capabilities  will be built  to enable  collaboration  \nwith  the private  sector  for testing  the latest  technologies.  DDOT  has already  installed  limited  \nautonomous  vehicle  test facilities  in an urba n environment  for specific  users,  but Smart  DC will \nbroaden  this infrastructure  to a wider  area.  \nThe District  already  has OBUs  installed  on District  taxis,  and through  Smart  DC will expand  \ninstallations , in partnership  with  both public and private vehicle  operators,  on fleets  such  as \ntransit  vehicles,  Capital  Bikeshare  bikes,  and freight  delivery  vehicles.  \nIntegration:  The pilot  project  implementation  will be aided  by past  work  acquiring  technical  \nknow -how,  engaging  stakeholders,  and public  outreach.  Data  from RSEs  and OBUs  will be \nintegrated  into DDOT’s  existing  management  centers,  including  the Traffic  and Snow  \nManagement  Centers,  and integrated  into public  space  management  systems,  asset  \nmanagement  systems,  and system  performance  monitoring.  The integrati on of higher -end data  \nanalytics  capability  as well as usage  is fundamental  to DDOT’s  smart  city endeavors.  \nThe data  generated  from  Smart  DC will feed  back  to a smarter  traffic  management  center  and \nbe used  to develop  detailed  analyses  of travel  time,  delay s, and other  performance  metrics.  \nBetter  data  fusion  will lead  to a comprehensive  picture  of the transportation  system.  New  tools  \nwill allow  analysts  to overlay  permits,  traffic,  truck  routing,  and asset  management  systems  to \nprovide  real-time  updates  to employees  and external  users . Smart  DC will provide  an impetus  \nto integrate  all the generated  data  into a single  unified  platform.  DDOT  currently  is leading  a  \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  8 study  to identify  opportunities  to address  multimodal  congestion  and measure  overall  \ntransportation  system  performance.  The study will result  in a public -facing  web -based  \nvisualization  tool that can be built  to incorporate  additional  data  coming  from  Smart  DC \ninstallations.  \nEvaluation : The District  is committed  to data -driven  decision  making.  The Smart  DC program  \nwill have  a substantial  evaluation component,  grounded  in DDOT’s  research  partnership  with  a \nregional  college  and university  consortium  led by Howard University . This consortium conducts \nresearch projects  for DDOT and connects  students  to career  opportunities  in transportation.   \nDDOT  believes  that open  data  leads  to better  evaluation.  In addit ion to the generated data,  all \nthe design  files,  installation  methodologies,  and quality  control  issues  will be available  online  \nfor public  use. These  will be made  available  via real-time  data  feeds,  which  can be utilized  by \npublic  and private  partners.  Additionally, all the software  and algorithms  developed  during  the \nSmart  DC pilot  will be  open  source  and available  for public  participation  through  the Distric t’s \nGitHub  page  and USDOT’s  Open  Source  Application  Development  Portal.  All the real time  data  \nfrom  existing  and proposed  sources  will be made  available  to data  scientists  to aid in app and \nservice  development  by private  partners.   \nThe District has already  taken  a step  in this direction  by publishing  real time  traffic  signal  data  \nfor interested  parties  to develop  applications.  The District sponsors  regular  hackathons  and \nother  contests  with  data  scientists  and enthusiasts  to develop  a hacker  culture  using  \ngovernment  data,  facilitating  a vibrant  dialogue  between  agencies  and users . The Smart  DC \npilot  will further  enhance  this process  by providing  more  real-time  data,  Internet  of Things  \nsoftware development kits (SDK s), access  to connected  vehicle  infrastr ucture,  and other  \ninteresting  scenarios.  These  projects  will be coordinated  and convened  through  the Smart  DC \npartnerships  liaison.  \nThe strength  of the Smart  DC pilot  is found  in the project’s  commitment  to data  collection,  \nmanagement,  and analysis,  which involv es deployment  of multiple  interconnected  data  \ncenters.  The Smart  DC pilot  will be a cross -cutting  effort,  improving  the transportation  \nexperience  for all modes  in the District , including  people  walking,  biking,  taking  transit,  or \ndriving  personal  vehicles,  delivery  trucks,  or vehicles  for hire.  \n1.4. Program  Management  Approach  \nDDOT  will build  on existing  structures  and procedures  to manage  the Smart  DC pilot  project.  \nThe agency  anticipates  using  a standard  systems  engineering  approach,  supplemented  with  \nstrong  integrated  relationships within  DDOT  and with  partners.   \nImplementation will be led by DDOT’s  Chief  Performance  Officer  (CPO) , John  Thomas.  As CPO,  \nJohn  oversees  agency  performance  and the agency’s  Office  of Information  Technology  and \nInnovation  (OITI ). Prior  to becoming  the CPO,  John  led DDOT’s  Urban  Forestry  Administration,  \nwhere  he oversaw  the geocoding  of all of the District’s  150,000  street  trees  to automate  daily  \nwork  and integrate  resident  feedback,  the use of LiDAR  scans  to document  and track  tree \nhealth,  and the creation  of the innovative  “Canopy  Keepers”  program  to enlist  citizen  \nvolunteers  to maintain  the District’s  tree canopy.  John  will coordinate  a cross -agency  leadership  \nteam  in the implementation  of Smart  DC, including  DDOT’s  ITS, Parkin g, Research,  Planning,   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  9 Policy,  and Asset  Management  divisions.  John  will also coordinate  a broader  set of agency  and \nprivate  stakeholders  from  across  the District  to implement  Smart  DC. \nFigure 5 | Pilot Program Management Structure  \n \n \nImplementation of the Smart DC pilot project will advance over a four -year timeline, as detailed \nin Table 1 . \nTable 1 | Smart DC Timeline  \n \nQ1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4\nInitial industry notification\nFormalization of core partnerships\nDefine and schedule deployment *\nInstall RSE in pilot areas *\nInstall OBU in fleets * *\nInstall smart kiosks * * *\nIntegration of data into smart centers *\nPerformance metrics *\nBenchmarking data * * *\nEstablish evaluation consortium\nProject-level evaluation reports\nProgram-level evaluation reportsIntegration and Data/Analysis\nEvaluationPartnerships\nInfrastructure2016 2017 2018 2019 2020\nPlanning and coordination\nMajor deliverables * \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  10 The District  can point  to past  successes  in speedily  managing  and coordinating  high -visibility  \nprojects  among  a multitude  of stakeholders,  such  as its administration  of USDOT  grants  made  \nthrough  the American  Recovery  and Reinvestment  Act. District  lead ership  as a whole  is \nproviding  solid  backing  to DDOT  for this initiative,  and,  as outlined  within  Section 3, this \nleadership  positions  DDOT  for success  in implementing  new  smart  city technologies.  The \nDistrict  is also on sound  footing  to leverage  the resou rces of private  firms  to execute  critical  \ncomponents  of Smart  DC. In December  2014,  the District Council  enacted  the “Public -Private  \nPartnership  Act of 2014,”  which  authorizes  the District  to review  opportunities  in which  a \nprivate  entity  would  perform  one or more  functions  normally  undertaken  by the government.  \n2. Population  Characteristics  \nThe District’s  continually  growing  population , along  with  its other  characteristics , distinctly  \nqualifies  the District  as the ideal  city for the Smart  City Challenge.  As of the 2010  Census,  the \nDistrict had 601,723  residents , a 5.2 percent  increase  from  the 2000  Census  count.  By 2015,  the \nUS Census  Bureau  estimates  the District’s  population  had grown  to 672,228,  representing \nalmost  12 percent  growth  in the past  five years.  \nThe District’s  population  density  is moderately  high,  with  9,857  people  per square  mile  of land  \narea  as of the 2010  Census , with over 11,000  people  per square  mile  estimated for 2015.  This \ndensity  level  ranks  in the top ten for large  US cities.   \nAccording to  2015  population  estimates,  the \nDistrict is currently  home  to 13.7  percent  of the \nurbanize d area’s  population,  but during  the \nworkday  the population  of the District  surges  \nwith  a net daytime  inflow  of 339,836  \ncommuters , increasing  the share  of the \nurbanized  area  population  to 20 percent.8 \nThe District  can serve  as a model  for a range  of \nother  cities  because of the land  use patterns , \nposition  within  the region,  as well as national  \npresence . The urban  core  of the city and inner  \nneighborhoods  with  mid-rise housing  form  a big \ncity environment , but the histor ic and outlying  \nneighborhoods  resembl e those of mid-size and \nsmaller  cities , with row houses  and detached  single  family.  The District ’s street  grid is fine-\ngrained  and a mix of uses  predominates  throughout  the city, typically  creating  small  \ncommercial  strips near  housing.  The ideals  of smart  growth  are largely  realized  in the District . \nThis landscape  provides  a pragmatic  setting  to apply  new  smart  city ideals  in an urban  setting.  \nLand use and development  patterns  of the District  support  high  levels  of transit ridership,  \nwalking,  and biking.  As of 2014  estimates,  almost  60 percent  of District  residents  commuted  via \nmodes  other  than  the personal  car. The compact  nature  of the city and the diversity  of \n                                                      \n8 US Census Bureau, OnTheMap Application (2015).  Figure 6 | District Employment Flows  \n \nSour ce: US Census, OnTheMap Application  \n \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  11 transportation  choices  already  in use make  the \nDistrict  an ideal  location  to test the implementation  \nof smart  and c onnected  city concepts.  \nSmart  DC will help  the District  use transportation  \ninvestments  to create  pathways  to the middle  class  \nand support  the existing  low- and moderate -income  \npopulation.  Recent  popu lation  growth  has impacted  \nhousing  affordability  and accessibility  for low- and \nmoderate -income  households.  In the District, 64  \npercent  of the lowest  income  residents  and one-\nthird  of families  with  incomes  up to $54,000  devote  \nat least  half of their  income  to housing.9 While  the \nDistrict’s  extensive  transit  system  enables  these  \nresidents  to save  on transportation  costs,  the \nDistrict must continue to address ways to bridg e the \neconomic  and digital  divide . \n3. Smart  City Characteristics  \n3.1. Existing  Public  Transporta tion System s \nThe District  has robust  public  transportation  \nsystem s. The primary  transportation  agency is \nWMATA,  which  provides  Metrorail,  Metrobus,  and \nMetroAccess  services.  Additionally,  the District  \nfunds  the operation  of the seven -route  DC Circulator  \nbus system,  and will soon  open  the first DC Streetcar  \nline.  More  than  one third  of District  residents  commute  to work  via transit,  and the District  now \nprovides  free transit  rides  to all District  public and charter school  students  through  high  school.  \nAdditi onally,  the District  is served  by commuter  rail services  provided  by the Virginia Railway \nExpress ( VRE) and Maryland Area Regional Commuter  (MARC ), as well as intercity  travel  by rail \n(Amtrak),  bus (various  private  operators),  and air (Reagan  National  and Dulles  airports ).  \nAlong  with  neighboring  jurisdictions,  DDOT  operates  the Capital  Bikeshare  system,  which  \nfunctions  as another  regional  transit  system  that serves  over  10,000  rides  daily,  and has almost  \n30,000  annual  members.  Capital  Bikeshare  was an early pioneer  in providing open  data  and has \nleveraged  private  interest  in the system  into improved  approaches  to rebalancing  bicycles  and \nbetter customer  experience.  \nDDOT  collaborates  closely  with  WMATA  and other  regional  partners  to further  the \neffectiveness  of these  transportation  systems,  and anticipates  implementing  smart  solutions  \nacross  agencies.  This will allow  smart  investment  within  the District  to spread  functionally  and \nintellectually.  DDOT,  WMATA,  and other  regional  stakeholders  are currently  worki ng to \nimplement  off-board  fare payment  or fare collection  systems  along  high -ridership  bus corridors,  \npotentially  through  a public -private  partnership  (P3). Further,  unified  fare payment  \n                                                      \n9 Wes Rivers , “Going, Going, Gone: DC’s Vanishing Affordable Housing ,” (DC Fiscal Policy Institute, 2015).  Figure 7 | District Demographics  \n \nSource : US Census, ACS 5-Year Estimates  \n \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  12 technologies  have been proposed . This initiative  would  be leveraged  by the Smart  DC program  \nto implement  transit  kiosks  with  broader  functionality,  including  wifi access.  \n3.2. Past  Demonstration  Projects  \nDDOT  is an innovative  agency  that strives  to advance  the state  of the practice  in urban  \ntransportation  and is no stranger  to demonstrating  progressive  transportation  approaches.  \nDDOT  has recently  deployed  several  new  technology  initiatives  that have  proven  successful  \nthroughout  the city, including  the Advanced  Transportation  Management  System  (ATMS),  the \nRideDC  Portal  Dashboard,  and the Transportation  Online  Permitting  System  (TOPS).  The ATMS  \nis a comprehensive  system  that leverages  technology  to improve  traffic  safety  and enhance  \nmobility  by using  real-time  traffic  data  from  cameras,  speed  sensors,  probe  vehicle  systems,  \nand exte rnal data  sources  to appropriately  manage  traffic.  The ATMS  is also capable  of \ngenerating  incident  response  plans  and serves  as a platform  for implementing  the plans  to \nimprove  traffic  flows  within  the District.  RideDC  is a customized,  web -based  tool that allows  \nusers  to easily  create  their  own  dashboard  that display s a dynamic  map  of transit  options  and \narrival  times  near  their  desired  location,  such  as a local  business.  TOPS  is a one-stop  online  \nsystem  that enables  users  to apply  for any type  of permit  required  for use of the public  space  \nwithin  the District.   \nIn addition,  DDOT  has a federally - and locally -funded  research  program  that has supported  the \ndevelopment  of a number  of tools  that are now  fully  deployed,  including  snow  plow  tracking  \n(available  at snowmap.dc.gov),  countdown  pedestrian  signals,  stormwater  management  tools,  \nand parking  pricing.  Current  research  projects  include  microsimulation  to support  TSP \ndeployment  in the urban  core,  a variable  pricing  pilot  for parking  in Penn  Quarter  and \nChinato wn, and several  Strategic  Highway  Research  Program  2 (SHRP2)  Implementation  \nAssistance  Program  grants.  One such  SHRP2  Implementation  Assistance  Program  grant  will \nsupport  migrating  to three -dimensional utility  mapping  in coordination  with  a major  power  line \nundergrounding  project  underway.  \nThe District has also demonstrated  the use of both  autonomous  and connected  vehicles  on its \ncity streets  and is one of a handful  of jurisdictions  with  authorizing  legislation  already  in place  \nto permit  autonomous  vehicles  to operate  on its streets.  DDOT  is currently  partnering  with  car \nmanufacturers  to share  signal  timing  information  for developing  eco-friendly  vehicles.   \nDDOT  is in the final  stages  of implementing  TSP at its portion of over 300 locations  regionally  \nthrough  TIGER  funds  awarded  to the Metropolitan  Washington  Council  of Governments  \n(MWCOG) . The deployment  of this technology  has required  the same  type  of regional  \ncollaboration  on hardware  and implementation  decisions  that will be needed  to successfully  \nimplement  Smart  DC. Technologies  like these,  along  with  the willingness  to approach  \nprogressive  and innovative  concepts,  show that the District  is a viable  environment  to \ndemonstrate  smart  strategies.  The desire  to innovate  is present  throughout  the agency  and has \nstrong  support  from  lead ership.  \n3.3. Leadership  \nThe District is  prepared  to make  a major  investment  to become  the leading  smart  city in the \nUnited  States.  Under the leadership of Mayor Muriel Bowser , the District  is commit ted to \nadvancing the proposed  pilot  projects  and utilizing  best  practices  to implement  them   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  13 “…the District of Columbia is answering the \ncall to create innovative solutions to \naddress the challenges we face as a city. \n[We] will use technology to improve the \nway we work and serve residents —\ndelivering better access and transparency \nacross District government. [Our] work will \nbe critical in our efforts to expand \nopportunity and create more pathways to \nthe middle class.”  \n-Mayor Bowser, May 2015  throughout  the District . The existing  institutional  \nframework  will allow  the District  to capitalize  on \nthe Smart  City Challe nge opportunity.  The \nDistrict ’s commitment  to innovation is  exhibited  \nby the creation  of the Director  of Technolo gy \nInnovation  position  for OCTO . Mayor  Bowser  took  \noffice  in January  2015  for a four  year  term,  so \nthere  will be consistent  political  leadership  \nthroughout  nearly  the entire  anticipated  life of \nthe grant.   \nThe Deputy  Mayor  for Planning  and Economic  \nDevelopment  has made  the digital  city a core  strategy  of economic  and real estate  \ndevelopment,  with  the planned  development  of an Innovation  Hub on the St. Elizabeths  East \nCampus.  The first investment  of the R.I.S.E.  Demonstration  Center  has already  helped  to link \nthe surrounding  community,  including  some  of the lowest  income  areas of the District,  with  \ntechnology  sector  opportunities.  \nThe District  has also shown  leadership  in investing  in technology  sector  business  incubation.  \nThe District  invested  $200,000  in 1776,  a tech  startup  incubator  based  in the city. The incubator \nnow  works  with  hundreds  of startups,  many  of them  in the transportation  sector.  Smart  DC will \nbuild  additional  partnerships  around  infrastructure  and data  on the basis  of existing  ones . \nWithin  DDOT,  the Smart  DC leadership  team  will provide  ongoing  institutional  support , and \norganizational  investments  will be made  as the initiative progress es. As noted  in the program  \nmanagement  structure  (Figure  3), the agency  will draw  support  from  a number  of key agency  \ngroups,  all of whom  have  a history  of developing  and supporting  successful  pilots  and full \ndeployments  of new  technologies.  \n3.4. Sharing  Economy  \nThe District  has been  an early  adopter  and supporter  of the sharing  economy  in transportation  \nin particular.  This innovation  has been  driven  by the District’s  residents’  needs:  over  half of \nDistrict residents  commute  by means  other  than  their  personal  automobile  (only  40 percent  of \nworkers  drive alone  or carpool)  and over  one-third  of its households  do not own  a vehicle.10 In \nthis context,  there  is a need  for alternative  approaches  to getting  around.  \nDDOT  piloted  its first bikeshare  program  in 2008  and launched  the successful  Capital  Bikeshare  \nprogram  in 2010.  Carsh aring  services  have  been  present  in the District  for over  15 years  and the \nDistrict was one of the ear ly markets for th ese services . Zipcar,  an early carshare  operator,  \nopened  its second  location  in the District in 2001,  and the District was the third  US city to bring  \nin car2go  point -to-point  carshare  in 2012.  In four  years,  car2go  has grown  from  200 vehicles  to \n700 and now  counts  one in twelve District residents  as a member.  Today  there  are both  \ntraditional  and point -to-point  private  providers  operating  within the District , several  of whom \nuse on-street  spaces  provided  through  agreement  with  DDOT.  DDOT  has strong  relationships  \n                                                      \n10 U.S. Census Bureau, 2010 -2014 American Communi ty Survey 5 -Year Estimates.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Sm art City   February 4, 2016  14 with  its carshare  providers  and has innovat ed performance  metrics  for the use of on-street  \nspaces  as part of those  agreements.  \nThe District is also a strong  market  for transportation  network  compa nies (TNCs).  In addition  to \nthe major  national  platforms, Uber  and Lyft,  the District has a local  startup,  Split,  and is the \nsecond  market  for Bridj.  Notably,  both  of these  latter  services  are focused  on shared  rides,  \nwhich  the District’s demographic  and geographic  characteristics  help  support.  The District has \nalready  begun  conversations  with  the TNCs  and the DC Taxicab  Commission  to pursue  data  \nsharing,  and other  projects  could  follow.  \n3.5. Open  Data  \nThe District  is fully  committed  to making  its data  accessibl e to the public , in particular  through  \nits open  data  web  site at opend ata.dc.gov.  The District  has taken  steps  to ensure  that its data  is \nopen  and discoverable  in the hopes  of fostering  greater  public  participation  and collaboration.  \nBy instituting  an active open  data  policy,  the practices  of the city are grounded  in dynamic  \nprinciples  including  transparency,  collaboration,  openness,  and discoverability.  \nThe District  is also utilizing  open  source  technology  to increase  public  access  to the stream  of \ninforma tion it creates  and receives  from  agencies  and partners  throughout the  city. Smart  DC \nwill build  on these  foundations  of 21st-century  technology  to allow  residents,  commuters  and \nvisitors  to make  more  informed  decisions  about  their  government  and community . \n4. Pilot  Project  Site Map  \nTo initiate  Smart  DC, pilot  projects  will be executed  concentrating  on the USDOT’s  three  top \ntechnology  priorities  for the Smart  City Challenge —urban  automation,  connected  vehicles,  and \nintelligent,  sensor -based  infrastructure —acro ss targeted  geographic  areas.  The pilot  projects  \nwill be focused in  the core  area,  as well as other key corridors  around  the District , chosen  \naccording  to following  criteria:  \n\uf0b7 Building  on existing  capital  projects  or planning  initiatives.  \n\uf0b7 Identified  in the District’s  Long -Range  Multimodal  Transportation  Plan,  moveDC,  as \nsupportive  of high -capacity  transit . \n\uf0b7 Identified  in the District’s  Vision  Zero  Action  Plan  as “high  fatality”  corridors . \n\uf0b7 Representative  of geographic,  demographic,  and economic  diversity  throu gh inclusion \nof all eight  Wards  of the District . \nBased on these criteria, Smart DC will focus on the downtown area and the  following corridors : \n\uf0b7 16th  Street  \n\uf0b7 Georgia  Avenue  \n\uf0b7 H Street/Benning  Road  \n\uf0b7 New York Avenue  \uf0b7 Martin  Luther  King  \nAvenue/Minnesota  Avenue  \n\uf0b7 Penn sylvania  Avenue  \n\uf0b7 Wisconsin  Avenu e\nThe Smart DC pilot area includes  36 of 40 Metrorail  stations  in the District  as well as diverse \nresidential and business areas . In addition,  the George  Washington  University  (GWU)  campus,  \nthe Southwest Ecodistrict,  and the St. Elizabeth s East campus will serve  as “Smart  Hubs,”  \nhosting  Smart  DC applications,  as well as other  smart  city elements  beyond  transportation,  \naddressing  sustainability,  health,  and other  fields.  Smart  city deployments  in these  locations  \nhave already be gun and they  possess  institutional  support  for further  research  and testing.    \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  15 Figure  8 | Smart  DC Pilot  Areas  \n \n \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  16 5.

Risks  and Mitigation  \nThe District  and DDOT  have  a proven  track  record  of effecti vely deploying  state -of-the-art \ntechnology  project s and programs  by successfully  identifying  and managing  the inherent  risks  \nof such  deployments  through  a robust  risk mitigation  and management  strategy.  DDOT  also has \nthe framework  in place  to manage  grant s that involve  multi -agency  stakeholders.  In the recent  \npast  DDOT  has successfully  managed  grants  from  USDOT  (including  High  Speed  Intercity  \nPassenger  Rail and TIGER  funds  through  the Federal  Railroad  Administration,  and Value  Pricing  \nPilot  funds  through  the FHWA ), the Department  of Homeland  Security,  and other  federal  \nagencies.  DDOT  has identified  technical,  institutional,  and policy  risks  associated  with  Smart  DC, \nalong  with  mitigations.  Table  3 identifies  risks  and potential  mitigation  strategies.  \nTable  3 | Summary  of Risks and Mitigation  Measures  \nRisks  Mitigation  \nTechnological   \nDDOT  will deploy  and test state -of-the-art \ntechnology  as part of this program.  There  are \ntechnical  risks  in such  deployments.  These  risks  \ninclude,  but are not limited  to: \n\uf0b7 Lack  of consistent  standards . \n\uf0b7 Market -readiness  of technologies  in a vibrant,  \nmulti -modal,  urban  environment . \n\uf0b7 Interoperability  across  agencies,  jurisdictions , \nand transportation  modes . \n\uf0b7 Public  acceptance  and market  penetration  of \nnew  technologies . \n\uf0b7 Demonstrating quantifiable benefits that can \nbe traced back to new deployments.  \n\uf0b7 Sustainability  of connected  vehicle  \ninfrastructure  beyond  grant  life cycle . The District  has an innovation  culture  and \nexperience  in deploying  new  transportation \ntechnologies.  System -users  are early  adopters  of \ninnovative  technological  solutions,  and past  \nexperience  has identified  mitigations , e.g.: \n\uf0b7 Develop  technical  specifications  during  Phase  I \nand Phase  II application,  rather  than  after  \ngrant  award . \n\uf0b7 Adopt  an incremental  and iterative  approach  \nto deploying  assets . \n\uf0b7 Follow  the District’s ITS and Open  Data  \nstandards  and philosophy  to avoid  getting  \nlocked  into proprietary  solutions . \n\uf0b7 Leverage  lessons  learned  from  other  \njurisdictions  that had similar  deployments . \nInstitutional   \nManaging  and operating  transportation  system s \nrequires  coordination  across  a set of traditional  \nstakeholders.  Given  the District ’s geographical  \nsetting  and travel  patterns,  other  stakeholders  \ncome  into play,  including  state  DOTs,  police  forces  \nof Virginia  and Maryland,  county  DOTs,  MWCOG,  \nthe federal  government,  FBI, Secret  Service,  and \nothers.  This leads  to some  challenges  and \nopportunities:  \n\uf0b7 Different  agencies  have  different  risk \nappetite s, tolerance s, and thresholds.  \n\uf0b7 Intero perability  and consensus  across  agency  \nand jurisdictional  boundaries.  \n\uf0b7 Incorporating  Smart  DC concepts  and \nimplementation  into standard  business  \nprocess.  DDOT has worked closely with federal  and \nregional agencies to establish protocols and \nmaintains working  groups that can serve as a \nmodel for smart city programs:  \n\uf0b7 Scale  of DDOT  responsibilities  as a state/city  \nDOT  mean  DDOT  is more  integrated  and \nnimble  in addressing  system -level  issues.  \n\uf0b7 Autonomous  vehicles  feature  prominently  in \nexisting policy documents . \n\uf0b7 Experience  managing  interagency  processes,  \nrecognizing  the risk profile  of an agency,  and \ndeveloping  a customized  communication  \nstrategy.  \n\uf0b7 Existing  forums  in the District  and the region  \nfor these  discussions  to occur.  \n\uf0b7 Including m aintenance  and operating  costs of  \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  20 Risks  Mitigation  \nassets  as part of funding  plan . \n\uf0b7 Marketing and education about Smart DC \nthrough goDCgo.  \nPolicy   \nAspects  of Smart  DC could  require  policy  changes.  \nSome  of the policy  risks  include:  \n\uf0b7 Implications  of connected  vehicles  on system  \nsecurity,  particularly  in conjunction  with  open  \ndata . \n\uf0b7 Limited  experience  thus  far in implementing  \n2014  Public -Private  Partnerships  Act. \n\uf0b7 Potential  liability  for information  provided  \nthrough  open  data  channels.  The District has already worked to set the \nfoundation for policy needs:  \n\uf0b7 DDOT has the legislative and policy framework \nin place to launch the program.  (the District  \nwas one of the first jurisdictions  to pass  \nlegislation  on autonomous  vehicles ) \n\uf0b7 Engagement  with  the District’s  P3 office  will \nidentify  opportunities  to utilize  P3s to \nimplement  and maintain  Smart  DC. \n \n7. Partnerships  and Stakeholders  \nSmart  DC envisions  partnerships  in three  broad  areas:  technology  deployment,  data  \nmanagement,  and evaluation.  DDOT  has existing  partnerships  in each  of these  three  areas,  and \neach of these may involve overlap of subject matter . The District has had initial conversations  \nwith potential partners for Smart DC projects, but in order to preserve flexibility, no formal \nletters of commitment have been solicited during this phase. All current partne rships discussed \nin this application will be incorporated into the Smart DC initiative overall.  \n7.1. University  partnerships  \nDDOT  and the District  more  broadly  have  strong  partnerships  with  the universities  in the \nregion.  Currently,  Howard  University  leads  a consortium  with  GWU , George  Mason  University,  \nVirginia  Tech,  Morgan  State  University,  and the University  of the District  of Columbia  to support  \nDDOT ’s Research,  Development,  & Technology  Transfer  Program  and the agency as a whole . \nThrough  this university  consortium,  DDOT  develops  and conducts  research  projects,  connects  \nwith  current  students  for internships,  and has access  to experts  for project  panels  and program  \nreviews.  Howard  University  also houses  the DDOT  Transportation  Safety  Data  and Research  \nCenter,  which  serves  as a repository  and resource  to help  DDOT  analyze  traffic  data  and design  \nstrategies  to make  the District’s  streets  safer  for motorists,  cyclists  and pedestrians.  \nBeyond  contractual  relationships,  DDOT  staff  regularly  partner  more  informally  with  professors  \nand students  at local  universities  to provide  hands -on learning  experiences  and provide  insight  \nand data  to university -led research.  Many  students  have  completed capstone  or studio  projects  \nfocused  on DDOT  issues,  with  direct  input  from  DDO T staff.  DDOT  has also provided  in-kind  \nsupport  for researchers’  projects,  such  as attaching  data  loggers  to Capital  Bikeshare  bikes  for a \npublic  health  evaluation.   \nBeyond  DDOT,  District  government  is connected  to several  other  university  collaborations.  DC is \none of the founding  members  of the MetroLab  Network  with  Georgetown  University,  GWU , \nand Howard  University.  The Network  was launched  as part  of the White  House’s  Smart  Cities   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  21 Initiative.  The MetroLab  schools  currently  cooperate  throughout  the Distric t on several  large - \nand small -scale  public  health,  transportation  and sustainability  programs  and initiatives.  \nClosely  related,  the OCTO  DC-Net program  has partnered  with  the GWU -led Capital  Area  \nAdvanced  Research  and Education  Network  (CAAREN).  This is an advanced  regional  high -speed  \nfiber  optic  network  providing  dedicated  research,  education  and community  focused  access  to \ncomputational,  storage  and network  services  in the greater  metropolitan  region,  and far \nbeyond.  Additionally,  multiple  GWU  scientists  and researchers  are conducting  extensive  \nresearch  into smart  city applications  in a variety  of realms.   \nThese  partnerships  provide  access  to critical  assets  that are not widely  available  within  \ngovernment.  Smart  DC will require  the integration  of transportation  and utilities  infrastructure  \nwith  Internet  technology  and the involvement  of academic  institutions  to research  and create  \nnew  smart  city environments  and experiences  for the next  generation . CAAREN  can provide  the \ncritical  pipeline  between  the District  and its MetroLab  university  partners  in areas  of sensing  \ntechnology  design  and use, utilities  and transportation  modeling,  new  vehicle  technologies,  and \nhuman -city systems  \n7.2. Regional  Partners  \nWhile  the District is the core  city of its metropolitan  area,  it cannot  operate  alone.  The District  \nregularly  partners  with  neighboring  jurisdictions  on transportation  and other  issues.  Formal  \nstructures  exist  to support  this: \n\uf0b7 MWCOG  is a forum  for regional  discussion  and coordination , and  houses the region’s  \nmetropolitan  planning  organization , the Transportation Planning Board (TPB).  \n\uf0b7 The MATOC  Program  is a coordinated  partnership  between  transpor tation  agencies  in \nthe District , Maryland,  and Virginia  that aims  to improve  safety  and mobility  through  \ninformation  sharing,  planning,  and coordination.  One of the projects  of this group  is the \nRegional  Integrated  Transportation  Information  System  (RITIS) , an automated  data  \nfusion  and dissemination  system  that provides  an enhanced  overall  view  of the \ntransportation  network . \n\uf0b7 WMATA  is the regional  transit  provider  and exists  through  a tri-state  compact  between  \nthe District , Maryland,  and Virginia.  \nThe Distri ct also regularly  engages  with  its federal  partners  to coordinate  operations,  policy,  \nand planning  between  District  and federal  lands,  including  the National  Park  Service,  the \nNational  Capital  Planning  Commission,  the Architect  of the Capitol,  and the US Capitol  Police.  \nFor example,  DDOT  recently  launched  a new  Circulator  bus route  on the National  Mall  in \npartnership  with  the National  Park  Service . Capital  Bikeshare  are also docks  located  on federal  \nlands  throughout  the city.  \nAn example of a broad partnership  is the SW Ecodistrict  Initiative, led by the National Capital \nPlanning Commission with local and federal partners. The initiative  is focused  on sustainability  \nand livability  at a neighborhood -level  planning  scale.  The initiative  plans  to implement  Internet -\nof-things  (IoT)  and urban  sensing  applications,  which  aim to develop  solutions  to challenges  \nrelated  to environmental  quality,  livability,  health,  and economic  activity.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  22 7.3. Private  and Non -Profit  Partner s \nThe District has a strong  network  of local  non-profit  partners  that strengthen  the city and work  \nwith  the District’s  agencies  to improve  outcomes  in a range  of areas.  These  partnerships  include  \nbusiness  improvement  districts  collaborating  on streetscape  projects  and the Ecodistricts  \nprogram , and the Washington  Area  Bicyclist  Association  helping  to maintain  trails  and teaching  \nkey parts  of DDOT’s  Safe Routes  to School  program.  \nAnother  existing  partnership  includes  close  coordination  with  Pepco , the local electricity  \nprovider , through  the DC Powerline  Undergrounding  (PLUG)  project,  which  aims  to improve  the \nresiliency  of the District’s  energy  network  by moving  key power  lines  underground.  \nAdditionally, DDOT is exploring other energy -related partnership oppo rtunities through the \nDistrict of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility  (DCSEU) , which administers programs to reduce \nenergy consumption and improve energy efficiency.  \nSupporting  ongoing  private  sector  partnering,  Mayor  Bowser  recently  established  the Office  of \nPublic  Private  Partnerships  (OP3)  with  the authority  to enter  into partnerships  in a variety  of \nsectors,  including  transportation,  utilities,  and recreation  facilities.  Using this and other \nopportunities, DDOT will strive for greater engagement with th e private sector through Smart \nDC. DDOT will build partnerships with the business community to make infrastructure smarter, \nexpanding on existing strong relationships exemplified by freight and auto show initiatives and \nin local business partnering seen in  the city’s business improvement districts.  \n8. Existing  Transportation  Infrastructure  \nThe District  has an array  of rail, bus, cycling,  and pedestrian  facilities  that compose  a true  \nmultimodal  and intermodal  transportation  network.  With  over  1,500  miles  of roadway (only  31 \nof which  are Interstates,  freeways,  or parkways),  DDOT’s  system  is primarily  urban  arterial  or \nlocal  in nature  with  a few major  freeway  corridors  of regional  and local  importance.  \nTable  4 | Transportation  Assets  in the District  \nAsset  Description  \nRoadway  System   \nTotal  mileage  \n-Arterial  miles  \n-Interstate /freeway  1,501  linear  miles  of roadway  \n107 linear  miles  \n28 linear  miles  \nBridges /Tunnels  228 bridges  (209  vehicle,  19 pedestrian) , 16 tunnels  \nSidewalks  1,495  linear  miles \nOn-road  bicycle  lanes  \nCycle  tracks  \nOff-road  trails  64 linear  miles  \n6 linear  miles  \n56 linear  miles  \nTraffic  Signals  1,652  traffic  signals  \nStreetlights  71,000  streetlights  \nParking  assets  13,525  parking  meters  on 18,000  metered  parking  spaces  \nTransit  Services  \nCirculator  Bus Service  on 43 linear  miles;  ridership  of 5.1 million  (2014)  \nStreetcar  7 linear  miles  of track , 15 streetcar  stops  (2016 planned opening)   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the Dis trict a Smart City   February 4, 2016  23 Asset  Description  \nRail Mass  Transit  \n(Metrorail)*  38 linear  miles  (118  system linear  miles) , 40 stations  (91 systemwide ) \n273.8 million unlinked passenger trips, 2013 ( 119.2  million  in District )11 \nCommuter Rail  VRE for Virginia, MARC for Maryland  \nBus Mass  Transit  \n(Metrobus)*  Service  on 261 linear  miles  of road \n132.1  million  unlinked  passenger  trips , 2013  (73.5 milli on in District)10  \nCommuter Bus  Various operators (7.6 million unlinked passenger trips in 2013)10 \nCapital Bikeshare  211 stations, with additional 40 awaiting installation  \n2.8 million trips in 2014 system -wide  \nShared  Mobility  \nProviders*   Uber , Lyft, Split, Bridj \nCarshare  providers  (Zipcar,  Enterprise,  car2go,  getaround)  \n*Assets  not owned  by the District   \n8.1. Intelligent  Transportation  Systems  \nITS are critical  to meet  the challenges  of managing  transportation  system s in the nation’s  \ncapital.  The Distric t is often  described  as diverse,  as are the DDOT ’s ITS assets.  With  over  1,700  \ntraffic  signals,  18,000  metered  parking  spaces,  271 miles  of communications  cable,  six \noperations  centers,  and many  other  assets,  the density  of ITS assets  is high and provides \nopportunities to advance the state of the practice . \n9. Data  and Integration  \nCapital  Data:  continuously  open,  shareable  and mappable  since  2007 . The District  has \nmaintained  a publicly -accessible  data  catalog,  with  most  District  government  agencies  \ncontributin g to over  700 (and  growing)  datasets.  A majority  of these  data  have  been  published  \nas Geographic  Information  Systems  (GIS)  map  services,  which  allow  for easy  querying  and \nfiltering  with  the added  benefit  of being  mappable  by default.  From  permits  to pothol es, all \ndata  are accessible  in a multitude  of formats  via the common,  publicly  accessible  geospatial  \nOpen D ata. It is the District  government’s  long -standing  view  that District  data  should  be open  \nand accessible  for public  use, and the District is among  the first cities  to formalize  this with  an \nOpen Data Policy ,12 which  encourages  the transparency,  collaboration,  openness,  and \ndiscoverability.  However,  certain  data  releases  are subject  to privacy  sensitivities.  Using  \nguidance  from  the Department  of Motor  Vehicles,  data  is managed  and shared  based  on \nguidelines  in the Driver’s  Privacy  Protection  Act (18 U.S.C.  §§ 2721 –2725).  \nRecently,  DDOT  has worked  to build  up real-time  data  availability  of its current  bus system  data.  \nThe DDOT  Transportation  Data  API curre ntly provides  real-time  Circulator  bus locations  (at 5 \nsecond  intervals),  fine-grained  estimates  of arrival  times  and delays,  and historic  usage  data.13 \nThis information  and allows  developers  to build  apps  with  some  of the highest -quality  data \navailable.  \nIn 2014,  DDOT  began  collected  bicycle  and pedestrian  data  from  permanent  count  stations.  \nBuilding  on four  existing  count  stations,  DDOT  will install  an additional  seven  counters  during  \n                                                      \n11 National Transit Database , Transit Profiles: 2013 Full Report  (Federal Transit Administration , 2014 ).  \n12 Draft Open Data Policy: https://drafts.dc.gov/docs/draft -open -data -policy  \n13 DDOT Hackathon Portal: https://ddot.portal.azure -api.net/   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  24 2015,  and will make  data  publicly  accessible.  DDOT  also has an existing  network  of permanent  \nvehicle  sensors  to assist  in managing  overall  traffic  flows.  \nInfused  and Enriched.  All the data  above  should  not simply  be made  open,  but should  be \nenhanced,  interrelated  and enriched  by integrating  data  across  transpor tation  business  systems  \nto the greatest  degree  possible.  Like other  transportation  agencies,  DDOT  collects  a variety  of \ninformation  on the specification,  operation,  and condition  data  of assets,  the transportation  \nnetwork,  and services.  Considered  independ ently,  these  data  are useful  but somewhat  limited  \nwhen  attempting  to answer  nuanced  questions  about  the state  of District transportation  \nsystem s or how  they  should  be used.  For example,  the enterprise  routing  system  for \noversize/overweight  loads  is useful  for prov iding  directions  to truckers  coming  to the District \nbut if the routing  system  is unaware  of permitted  road  closures,  the system’s  operational  \neffectiveness  is limited.  The District  need s truckers  and others  to have  a ‘persistently  connected  \nworkflow’  such that  any informatio n that is relevant  to the operation  must  be instantaneously  \navailable  and updated  seamlessly.   \nDDOT’s  approach  to this problem  is to place  GIS front  and center,  connecting  related  data  items  \n(both  spatial  and aspatial)  to the base  GIS centerline  network.  Any public  space  permit  which  \nDDOT  approve s is automatically  referenced  along  the GIS centerline  network.  Any roadway  \nconstruction  project  DDOT  begin s planning  for is registered  along  the GIS centerline  network.  \nAll conditions  and characteristics  about  the roadway  (number  of lanes,  pavement  condition,  \netc.) are referenced  along  the GIS centerline  network.  DDOT’s  Transportation  Integrated  \nEnterprise  Solution  (TIES)  is purpose -built  to conflate  and infuse  data  and make  it more  useful  \nacross systems.  As an additional  step,  these  same  data  are spatially  joined  to relevant  \ngeographies  (demographic,  political,  administrative)  to further  enhance  the usefulness  to all \nusers.   \nNext  Steps:  Infuse  Live Data  Streams.  All TIES data  are published  as GIS web  services  to ensure  \nall stakeholders  may rapidly  leverage  and incorporate  them  into their  workflows.  One downside  \nof the current  TIES process  is that it is a nightly  extract,  transform  and load  process  which  \npresents  only  a ‘snapshot’  in time.  This project  could  serve  as a vital  springboard  to bring  \nlive/transactional  data  systems  into persistently  connected  workflows.  A good  example  of the \nbeginnings  of this is with  DDOT ’s public  data  sharing  partnership  with  Waze.  The current  data  \nflow  is omnidirectional,  with  DDOT  as the recipient  of the Waze  data  feed.  DDOT  map s and \nanalyze s the Waze  traffic  feed  data  within  the internal  emergency  operations  centers  for snow  \nand traffic  incident  response.  Waze  would  like to receive  live permitted  closure  inform ation  but \nis unable  to because  DDOT ’s published  map  web  services  do not have  permitted  activity  live. \nDDOT  plan s to enable  “check -in/check -out” for specific  permit  types  like road  or lane  closures  \nand broadcast  these  changes  to the publ ic TIES data  streams.  With  this new  functionality,  \nWaze,  the freight  community  or a connected  vehicle  with  a route  scheduled  along  the route  will \nreceive instant notification . \nFor DDOT  and the District  as a whole,  data  sits squarely  in the center  of the picture.  For this \nproject,  DDO T will bring  its experience  gained  thus  far and make its data live by default  to the \ngreatest  exte nt possible.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  25 10. ITS Standards  and Architecture  \n10.1. ITS Architectures  and the Master  Plan  \nThe District developed  a Regional  ITS Architecture  in 2009  which  has been  used  as guidance  in \nimplementing  ITS projects.  The Architecture  identifies  data  flows  and connections  between  \nvarious  ITS components,  including  the traffic  management  center  and the field  intelligent  \ntran sportation  devices.  The architecture  also covers  the structure  of data  sharing  with  \nneighboring  agencies  such  as the Virginia  Department  of Transportation  and the Maryland  \nDepartment  of Transportation.  The DDOT  ITS team  is planning  to update  the existing  \nArchitecture  by incorporating  the new  data  flows  associated  with  the emerging  connected  \nvehicle  technologies  by following  national  ITS communication  standards,  such as the National  \nTransportation  Communications  for Intelligent  Transportation  System s Protocol  (NTCIP) . \n \nIn 2013  DDOT  also prepared  an ITS Master  Plan  in which  new  infrastructure  was proposed  for a \nfurther  fifteen  years,  based  on the needs  of traffic  operations  and incident  management.  The \nITS Master  Plan  documents  the existing  communication  infras tructure  and provides  a roadmap  \nfor future  communications  network  upgrade  and expansion.  \nIn designing  ITS systems  such  as Dynamic  Message  Signs  and CCTV  systems,  DDOT  strictly  \nfollows  NTCIP.  In addition,  DDOT  follows  the Manual  on Uniform  Traffic  Control  Devices  and \nDDOT’s  own  specifications  (Version  9.0) in designing  ITS structures.  In the future,  the agency  \nplans  to: \n\uf0b7 Follow  the WAVE  protocol  to send  the Traffic  Incident  Management  (TIM),  SPaT,  and \nMAP  messages  from  roadside  DSRC  units  to on-board  DSRC  units . \n\uf0b7 Convert  the current  proprietary  traffic  signal  control  data  to NTCIP -compliant  data . \n\uf0b7 Continuously  use the NTCIP  in the ITS design  and implementation . \n\uf0b7 Involve  AASHTO’s  efforts  in ITS standard  development . \n10.2. Documentat ion Sharing  \nAs a smart  city, the District  will develop  a portal  accessible  to all researchers,  companies,  and \nvendors.  The portal  would  provide  near  real-time  information  about  equipment  diagnostics,  \nBSM,  and other  information  from  RSE for public  access.  This will help  vendors  and standard  \ndevelopers  improve  products.  \n11. Goals  and Objectives  \nSmart  DC will be implemented  within  the context  of existing  plans,  such as Sustainable DC, \nmoveDC, and the Vision Zero Action Plan, which  outline  the high -level  vision  and objectives  for \nthe transportation  system s.  \nGoal : The goal  of Smart DC  is for the District to become  a connected city that benefits all \ncomponents of  the transportation system s–agencies, users, and infrastructure –and that the \ntransportation system s support  the District ’s systems and broader goals.   \n\uf0b7 Agencies  will have  more informed decision -making capabilities, save time deploying \nresources , and improve system performance .  \n\uf0b7 Users  will have  equitable acces s to information to make real -time travel deci sions  and \nwill be an active part of the solution by feeding  data  back to the system .   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  26 \uf0b7 Infrastructure  will communicate its status to help  users know when to alter their travel \nchoices  and to provide data for agencies to better hone their  services . \nObjective : The objective  of Smart DC  is to build  the foundation  to integrate  21st-century  \ntechnology  into the District ’s transportation system s. The District  will deploy  a platform that  \nwill provide all users the ability to provide feedback, test new technologies , and improve \nmovement of people, goods , and services within the city.  The District will build  subsidiary goals \nand objective s to feed into the overall goal . This will be an iterative  process forming  a \nfoundation for broad participation . With  this foundation , the District will leverage the newest \ntechnolog ies and provide feedback on existing  and emerging  technology.  \nDDOT ’s Multimodal  Congestion  Management  Study , currently underway, w ill provide an \nunderstanding  of District  transportation  systems ’ baseline  conditions . The performance  \nmeasures  component  of the Congestion  Study  will be complete  prior  to the submission  of the \nPhase  2 Smart  DC proposal,  and DDOT  will integrate  these  two processes  in the final  Smart  DC \nproposal.  DDOT  envisions  managing  performance  of Smart  DC based  on the pilot’s  program  \nframework,  with  specific  measures  for Smart  Agenc ies, Smart  Infrastructure,  and Smart  \nCitizens,  such  as: \nSmart  Agencies  \na. Reduction  in accident  identification  time . \nb. Reduction  in average  trip length  on selected  bus routes  and freight  deliveries.  \nc. Increased  efficiency  of addressing  service  requests  through  reduction  in man -hours  \ndeployed  for various  asset  categories.  \nd. Increased  data  analytics  capability  and development  of central  smart  transportation  \nmanagement  center  \nSmart  Infrastructure  \na. Increase  in actionable  data  collected  from  connected  infrastructure  and reduction  in \ninfrastructure  downtime  for signals,  streetlights,  parking  meters,  and other  assets.  \nb. Reduction  in traffic  and transit  delay  through  adaptation  by intelligent  signals.  \nc. Reduction in median respon se time for fire and emergency vehicles.  \nSmart  Citizens  \na. Increase  in participation  from  hackers,  consultants,  researchers,  and other  groups  to \naccess  data  from  District system s. \nb. Increase  in new  services  offered  by vendors  using  the District’s smart infrastructure.  \nc. Increase  in usage  of smart  parking  by city residents  and visitors.  \nd. Increase  in participation  from  business  owners  to schedule  deliveries  using  District \nsystem s. \n12. Capacity  and Commitment  \nDDOT  has prepar ed for Smart  DC through  system -level  planning  and individual  pilot  projects.  \nOver  the past  14 months,  in particular,  since  the start  of Mayor Bowser ’s Administration,  DDOT  \nhas elevated  the role of performance  and data  management  within  the agency.  Many  of these  \ninitiatives  will continue  and be elevated  further  through Smart  DC.  \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  27 12.1. Technical  Capacity  and Infrastructure  Readiness  \nAdvanced  Transportation  Management  System : DDOT  recently  implemented  ATMS  for traffic  \noperations  and event  management.  The ATMS  system  is capable  of generating  incident  \nresponse  plans  and serves  as a platform  for implementing  the plans  to improve  the traffic  flows  \nwithin  the District.  Real-time  traffic  data  from  cameras,  speed  sens ors, probe  vehicle  systems,  \nand external  data  sources  flows  into DDOT’s  Traffic  Management  Center  via ATMS  where  it is \nprocessed,  analyzed,  and responded  to appropriately  for traffic  management  purposes.   \nFiber  Backbone : In March  2016,  DDOT  will begin  cons tructing  a fiber  backbone , in partnership \nwith DC-Net and OCTO,  and associated  cameras  and vehicle  detection  stations  along  the \nDistrict’s freeways.  The fiber  network  on the freeways  will become  the backbone  of a future  \ncity-wide  communication  network  whic h will connect  to the Traffic  Management  Center  (TMC)  \nand DDOT  headquarters  building.  The new  cameras  will be an integrated  part of DDOT’s  \nmonitoring  system  for traffic  operations  and incident  management.  The new  vehicle  detection  \nstations  will be used  to collect  data  on count,  classification,  occupancy,  and vehicle  speed.   \nTransit  Signal  Priority : DDOT’s  TSP project,  carried  out with  the help  of an FTA TIGER  grant  in \npartnership  with  TPB, will demonstrate data  obtained  from  the new  technology  will inform  \ntraffic -flow  modeling  and real-world  impacts  of prioritization  on bus on-time  performance,  and \nscalability  and infrastructure  readiness.  \nConnected  Vehicles : DDOT  has embarked  on implementing  two connected  vehicle  test beds  in \npartnership  with  the commercial  vehicle  industry:  \na. Traffic  signal  data  sharing  pilot:  The pilot  aims  to integrate  signal  data  with  other  \napplications  so that connected  cars will estimate  red time  remaining  and reduce  carbon  \ndioxide  emissions.  The information  will be available  to interest ed partners,  and DDOT  \nwill receive  valuable  information  about  car emissions,  delays,  and signal  timings.  \nb. DSRC : The 2016  Washington  Auto  Show  also showcased  the benefits  of V2V and V2I \ntechnology  through  a connected  vehicle convoy.  The convoy  demonstrate d the \ncongestion -reducing  and life-saving  capabilities  of V2X applications.  In order  to most  \neffectively  showcase  V2X,  DSRC  radios  are installed  along  the route  to generate  SPaT  \nmessages  as well as TIM messages  to the vehicles  in the convoy.   \nParkDC  Pilot  in Penn  Quarter/Chinatown : DDOT  is deploy ing technology  to network  7,500  \nparking  meters  and implement  approaches  for parking  management.  These  technologies  and \napproaches  will result  in different  prici ng strategies  to encourage  turnover  or offer  parking  \nallowances  for residents.  This program  demonstrates th at existing  infrastructure  is ready  for \nfurther  integration  with  different  pricing  strategies  and individual  parking  space  tracking.  \nRemote  Monitoring  and Control  of Street Lights : DDOT  recently  started  implementing  remote  \nmonitoring  of all its light  poles.  The system  allows  real-time  monitoring  of each  luminaire’s  \nhealth  and increase  or decrease  of lumen  output.  The data  is accessible  through  an open  source  \ndata  protocol  and can be integrated  into DDOT’s  system  asset  management.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  28 12.2. Data/Analytic  Capacity  \nBig Data  Analytics : Since  2014,  DDOT  has invested  significant  time  and resources  in establishing  \na Data  Analytics  team.  This multi -disciplinary  team  gathers  and works  with  “big data”  to make  it \nmalleable  for agency  performance  management  and policy  making.  Recent  examples  include : \n\uf0b7 Gathering curbside use and off -street neighborhood parking data to compar e against \nresidential permit s, vehicle registration, parking citations, an d meter usage data . \n\uf0b7 Investigating demographics of pay -by-cell users and identifying patterns and trends that \nmay promote or hinder the growth of pay -by-cell adoption . \n\uf0b7 Identifying parking meter overstay patterns . \n\uf0b7 Query ing usage patterns of point -to-point ca rsharing to analyze operational policies . \n\uf0b7 Fusing bicycle infrastructure and Census mode share data to measure mobility, \naccessibility, and demographic patterns in cycling . \n\uf0b7 Analyzing programs and service data to gauge the equity of DDOT’s service delivery.  \n\uf0b7 Collect ing and using data  from  the locations  where  TSP is implemented,  including  \nidentifying  the locations  or corridors  where  the greatest  on-time  performance  increases  \nare observed  to inform  future  implementation  strategies.  \nCyber  Security : DDOT  initiated  a first-of-its-kind  project  to evaluate  the cyber  security  \npreparedness  of its physical  systems,  also called  CPS.  This comprehensive  assessment  includes  \nevaluating  current  connected  physical  infrastructure  vulnerabilities  and threats.  The evaluation  \nalso assess es the District ’s preparedness  to implement  connected  vehicle  infrastructure  and \nrecommend  procedures  and practices  to improve  such  infrastructure.   \nOpen  Data  Portal : On January  12, 2016,  Mayor  Bowser  announced  the District’s  Open  Data  \ninitiative  dem onstrating  a commitment  to utilize  technology  to innovate,  increase  transparency  \nand improve  accountability  across  government.  The policy  is centered  on the notion  of making  \nDistrict  data  “open  by default.”  Agencies  must  justify  why data  should  not be released  publicly  \nin its most  complete  form  rather  than  the public  being  obligated  to justify  why data  should  be \nreleased.  Consistent  with  this initiative,  DDOT  releases  datasets  whenever  feasible  on its Open \nData portal . Some  of the transportation  datasets  already  available  include  bicycle  lanes,  public  \nspace  permit  data,  bus routes  data,  and more.  The open by default approach  furthers  \ngovernment  transparency  and openness  and allows  the District  to leverage  its workforce  by \nhosting  “hackathons”  with  open -data  and crowdsourcing  applications  and software.  \nTransportation  Integrated  Enterprise  Solution : DDOT  uses  TIES to address  disparate  “stove -\npiped”  business  applications  from  various  DDOT  administrations  into a common  framework  for \nvisualization  and reporting.  TIES is a GIS-centric  solution  built  on HTML5,  which  is centered  \naround  linear  referencing.  Its current  scope  is to connect  several  DDOT  systems,  including  \nCityworks,  TOPS,  and utility  coordination  mapping  software  (Envista  Online  Map).   \nAutomated  Truck  Routing  for Single  Haul : Thousands  of oversized  or overweight  vehicles  are \nprovided  permits  for travel  within  the District  each  year.  Currently,  DDOT  staff  review  each  \nelectronic  submission  on TOPS  through  a manual  process.  DDOT  is working to improve  the way \nthe agency  processes  these  permits  by automat ing the safe routing  of large  loads, and \nautomat ing the permitting  of certain  loads  that fall within  certain  thresholds.   \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  29 Streetcar  e-Fare : DDOT  is developing  a Mobile  Fare  Payment  System  (MFPS)  to provide  an \nelectronic  fare option  for streetcar  passengers.  The system  will provide  a secure  form  of visual  \nconfirmation,  which  users  can present  upon  inspection  through  their  mobile  device.  The system  \nis still in the design  phase and  it will be based  on the latest  available  technology  platform  to be  \nflexible  and easily  scalable,  and based  on open  standards  to the extent  feasible.  E-fare data  will \nalso facilitate  DDOT’s  ability  to review  data  and performance  based  on, for example,  ridership  \nalongside  on-time  performanc e and automated  passenger  counters  (APCs).  \n12.3. Organizational  Capacity  \nAnacostia  Waterfront  Initiative : DDOT  is leading  the 30-year,  $10 billion  Anacostia  Waterfront  \nInitiative  (AWI)  to transform  the shores  of the Anacostia  River  into a world -class  waterfront.  In \ncoordination  with  19 regional  and federal  agency  partners,  the Anacostia  Waterfront  Initiative  \narea  straddles  the Anacostia  River  stretching  from  the Tidal  Basin  to the District’s  northeast  \nborder  with  Maryland.  DDOT  is coordinating  the multi -billion  dollar  infrastructure  investments  \nassociated  with  the initiative,  demonstrating  the institutional  capacity  for large,  complex  \nprojects.  In addition  to the AWI  program,  DDOT  is lead ing several  other  complex  public -private  \ninfrastructure  projects,  and this organizational  experience  will be brought  to bear  in Smart  DC. \nMultimodal  Congestion  Management  Study : DDOT  is in the midst  of a study  to assess  \nmultimodal  congestion,  and recommend  strategies  for remedying  existing  congestion  \nproblems,  including  one-, three -, and five-year  implementation  plans.  This study  will provide  an \norganizational  foundation  for Smart  DC, including  refining  infrastructure  and management  \nstrategies  to achieve  the Smart  DC outcomes.  \nTran Stat: Since  early  2015,  DDOT  has held  bi-weekly  “TranStat” meetings  to identify  and \naddress  agency  performance  management.  The meetings  have  targeted  everything  from  fleet  \nmanagement  to the removal  of abandoned  bicycles , and bring  together  leadership  team s \nacross  the agency,  including  contracting,  finance,  administrative  services,  engineering,  and \noperations , to engage  in constructive  and collaborative  problem  solving  environment . Smart  DC \nimplementation  would  be a standing  topic  at Tran Stat meetings  to inform  implementation  and \naddress  issues  early.  \n13. Levera ging  Resources  \nDDOT  anticipates  leveraging  Smart  DC funding  through  several  additional  sources  of funds,  \nincluding:  additional  federal  grants  and formula  funds,  additional  local  funds,  and partnerships  \nand in-kind  donations.  \nFederal  grants  and formula  fund s: DDOT  serves  as the state  department  of transportation  for \nthe District  and in that capacity  receives  FHWA  funding  to carry  out the core  highway  program.  \nThe projects  proposed  in Smart  DC will build  on the efforts  already  underway  to maintain  and \nimprove  infrastructure  and programs  supported  by these  FHWA  funds,  and can be coordinated  \nwith  already  planned  investments  on some  of the identified  corridors.  For example,  DDOT  has \nprogrammed  FHWA  funds  for reconstruction  projects  on Benning  Road  NE, Pennsylvani a \nAvenue  SE, and Minnesota  Avenue  NE—three  of the Smart  DC pilot  area corridors.  \nIn addition,  DDOT  has received several  grants  from FHWA  already  supporting  Smart  DC-type  \nprojects.  These  include  an FHWA  Value  Pricing  Pilot  Program  grant  for the parkDC  pilot  to  \nSmart DC    \nMaking the District a Smart City   February 4, 2016  30 investigate multimodal,  dynamic  parking  pricing  in the downtown.  DDOT  is also beginning  to \nimplement  an Off-Hours  Delivery  Program  through  federal  matching  funds.  \nThe District also partners  with  the Environmental  Protection  Agency’s  SmartWay  program,  \nwhich  helps  the freight  transportation  sector  improve  supply  chain  efficiency.  DDOT  anticipates  \ncombining  the SmartWay  program  with  a consolidation  center  project  to show  carriers  \npotential  cost savings  and emissions  reduction  through  use of the consolidati on center.  \nLocal  funds : DDOT  anticipates  using  local  funds  to leverage  and enhance  Smart  DC grant  funds.  \nFor example,  DDOT  has an existing  $6 million  local  fund  for transit  efficiency  enhancements.  A \nlarge  portion  of this funding  is expected  to be used  to fund  off-board  fare payment  kiosks  along  \nthe critical  16th  Street  NW bus corridor  that carries  over  20,000  riders  each  day.  Additional  \nlocal  funds  are available  for parking  meter s, streetlight s, and other  RSE investments.  \nBeyond  DDOT,  the Smart  DC pilot  envisions  leveraging  the investment  in DC-Net wifi led by the \nOffice  of the Chief  Technology  Officer.  Other  local  investments  led by the Deputy  Mayor  for \nPlanning  and Economic  Development  and others  will be aligned  with  the Smart  DC program.  \nPartnerships  and in-kind donations : DDOT  and the District  are committed to part nering  to pilot  \nand implement  new  technologies  and programs.  In the parkDC  pilot,  several  technology  \nproviders  are demonstrating  their  technologies  at little  or no cost during  the initial  phase  of the \nproject  to demonstrate  the viability  of their  solution  for eventual  broader  deployment.  \nSimilarly , the small cell antennas project engages the private sector in a pilot with several DC \nagencies . Public -private  partnerships  will be key to a successful  Smart  DC. DDOT  has leveraged  \nprogram  support  staff  from  around  the agency  to help  put these  pilots  into place.  \nSimilarly,  DDOT  is partnering  with  USPS  to share  route  data  and identify  delivery  spaces  where  \nand when  needed.  This information  presents  an opportunity  to site electric  vehicle  charging  \nequipment  to charge  new  USPS  electric  fleet  vehicles.  This partnership  will not only  provide  \ninvaluable  package  delivery  route,  time,  and frequency  data,  but will lower  emissio ns and \nimprove  safety,  due to electric  vehicles  and reduced  incidences  of double -parking.  DDOT  will \ninstall  equipment  on USPS  trucks  to provide  DDOT  with  tracking  information,  integrate  with  \nTSP,  and accumulate  data  on traffic  and route  impacts.  \nFinally,  the university  partnerships  and relationships  that DDOT  has built  through  its research  \nprogram  and other  innovative  efforts  provide  a strong  framework  to collaborate  with  the \nacademic  sector , and leverag ing their  research  and students  to take  the Smart  DC investment  \nfurther.  Academic  partners  will also be allies  in helping  to spread  the word  about  the initiative .
